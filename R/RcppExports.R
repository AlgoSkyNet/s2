#' Interpolation of points on unit sphere
#' 
#' Given a sequence of points on the unit sphere add interpolating points so
#' consecutive points are within distance `eps` of each other.
#' @param x Matrix with three columns representing the points.
#' @param eps Strictly positive real number. Values greater than or equal to pi
#' correspond to no interpolation.
#' @export s2point_interpolate
s2point_interpolate <- function(x, eps) {
    .Call('s2_s2point_interpolate', PACKAGE = 's2', x, eps)

#' Coerce list to s2polygon format
#'
#' This is a lowlevel function with no checking of parameters. Use at own risk!
#' 
#' It builds an `S2Polygon` using the C++ polygon builder. See the header file
#' inst/include/s2/s2polygonbuilder.h for details on how to use the arguments.
#' 
#' @param x List of loops
#' @param validate Logical to validate the s2polygon. Default is `TRUE`.
#' @param xor_edges Logical to indicate that edges should be 'xor'ed to avoind
#' multiple loops with common edges. Default is `TRUE`.
#' @param vertex_merge_radius Numeric indicating that vertices within this
#' distance should be merged. Defaults to zero (i.e. no merging).
#' @param edge_splice_fraction Determines when edges are spliced. See C++
#' header as indicated in the description of this function. Default is 0.866.
#' @param undirected_edges Logical to indicate that input edges should be
#' considered undirected.  Default is `FALSE`.
#' multiple loops with common edges. Default is `TRUE`.
#' @export s2polygon

#' Union and intersection of two s2polygons
#'
#' Given two lists of three column matrices representing S2Polygons calculate
#' the union or intersection. Assumes the polygons have already been validated
#' and put into the correct format by [`s2polygon`]. Note the input is only the
#' loops/rings of two polygons not the entire objects with areas and hole
#' indicators.
#' 
#' @param x List of loops represented by three column matrices.
#' @param y List of loops represented by three column matrices.
#' @aliases s2polygon_intersection
#' @export s2polygon_union

#' Point in s2polygon test
#'
#' Test whether points on the sphere are contained in a polygon on the sphere
#' 
#' @param points A three column matrix represtenting the points.
#' @param poly List of polygon loops represented by three column matrices.
#' @param approx Logical to use approximate testing of point in polygon (allows
#' points very slightly outside the polygon). Useful for allowing points
#' directly on the border.
#' @export s2polygon_contains_point
s2polygon_contains_point <- function(points, poly, approx = TRUE) {
    .Call('s2_s2polygon_contains_point', PACKAGE = 's2', points, poly, approx)
